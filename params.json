So, there is no way in which one can analyse usage in terms of users departments or category.\r\n\r\nThis project provides a way to analyse the originally produced MATLAB debug logs along with port activity log and login portal log.\r\n\r\nThis Django project has two apps, parser and reports.\r\n\r\nThe parser app takes care of processing the logs and creating database entries which will then be processed by the reports app to generate different graphs based on the toolboxes that matlab provides and the departments.\r\n\r\nThere are four types of reports:\r\n\r\n- `<site_root>/reports/list/` - List view of all entries\r\n- `<site_root>/reports/graphs/` - Stacked Bar view of all entries\r\n- `<site_root>/reports/departments/` - Bar Graph view of all entries from selected departments\r\n- `<site_root>/reports/time/` - Stacked Bar Graph view of all entries from selected time frame\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n==========\r\n\r\n- Setup the project using **`$ python3 setup.py install`**\r\n- Download or Clone the source code from [here](https://github.com/akshaykhadse/matlab-usage-stats/)\r\n- Copy the data files to **`data/`** folder. Data files should be as follows:\r\n\r\n  - **`LM_TMW.log`** - MATLAB Debug Log file\r\n  - **`src_ip_log`** - Port activity log file with timestamp and IP coloumns\r\n  - **`matlab_DB_active.csv`** - CSV file genrated from database `active` table\r\n  - **`matlab_DB_archive.csv`** - CSV file generated from database `archive` table\r\n\r\n  Sample data files can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8bbv1FqBgBVZ1NBdWE4VGd2Zlk?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n- Create database by **`$ make migrate`**\r\n- To update entries use **`$ make update`**\r\n\r\n  (This command needs to be run whenever log files are changed)\r\n\r\n- To start web interface **`$ make run`**\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\nDocs for this project can be found [here](https://matlab-usage-stats.readthedocs.io/)\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\n- flake8>=3.2.0\r\n- ldap3>=1.4.0\r\n- django>=1.10\r\n- coverage>=4.2\r\n- coveralls>=1.1\r\n- plotly>=1.12.9\r\n- sphinx>=1.4.8\r\n",
